# ICP_GUI_Cpp-CLI_HSLAE
_Created for the course "Integrated development environments for creating GUI applications" V. N. Karazin Kharkiv National University_

The program solves a heterogeneous system of linear algebraic equations of order 4 by the Kramer method in Visual Studio 2022 on C++ CLR using .NET Framework 4.8.
The Kramer method (using Kramer's formulas) is easy to program, but does not provide sufficient accuracy, which can lead to errors. The message "not a number" ("не число") may indicate that the solution does not exist, cannot be found using this method, or cannot be processed (division by 0). 

Project source files s3Form.cpp and s3Form.h.
